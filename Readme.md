# Fn Key Remix 2000

A simple autohotkey script that adds a bunch more keys to the Fn modifier key on the TongFang QC7 (aka Mag 15/Vapor 15 Pro/Fusion 15/Element) and other shortcuts to make the great keyboard amazing.

Additions are based on my preferences and focused on convenience and functionality. None of the existing Fn hotkeys are modified.

Function lock does not affect these hotkeys.

Feel free to fork/clone and edit the settings to your own liking, and send any suggestions this way!

List of key remaps:

```
Fn + Left Arrow          = Home
Fn + Right Arrow         = End
Fn + Up Arrow            = Page Up
Fn + Down Arrow          = Page Down
Fn + Enter               = numpad enter
Fn + Insert              = previous track
Fn + PrtSc               = next track
Fn + Del                 = play/pause track
Fn + 1 and Fn + ,        = numpad 1
Fn + 2 and Fn + .        = numpad 2
Fn + 3 and Fn + /        = numpad 3
Fn + 4 and Fn + l        = numpad 4
Fn + 5 and Fn + ;        = numpad 5
Fn + 6 and Fn + '        = numpad 6
Fn + 7 and Fn + o        = numpad 7
Fn + 8 and Fn + p        = numpad 8
! Fn + 8 produces asterisk due to NumpadMult for some reason !
Fn + 9 and Fn + [        = numpad 9
Fn + 0 and Fn + RAlt     = numpad 0
Fn + \                   = numpad /
Fn + *                   = numpad *
Fn + "+"                 = numpad +
Fn + "-"                 = numpad -
Fn + Mouse wheel down    = decrease volume
Fn + Mouse wheel up      = increase volume
Fn + Middle mouse button = play/pause media
Fn + Menu                = run task manager
```
